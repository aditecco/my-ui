MY-UI/Alphabet-UI

This project is a WIP experiment in extracting a full-fledged UI library from all the custom UI components I created in [my projects](https://gitlab.com/users/aditecco/projects).

The idea is to turn a bunch of ad-hoc, specific, hastily-coded UI components into a series of generic, predictable, multi-purpose, 100% reusable, 100% awesome UI elements. Easy! : )
